# Flaskapp for minikube

Running python flask app which shows the POD-ID where application is running

#### Getting Started

##### First we will use some other image for deployment than we will update that deployment to use this image.

###### Make Deployment with docker image-
```
kubectl create deployment myflaskapp-forminikube --image=docker.io/mjindal/myflaskapp-forminikube:latest
```
###### Expose Deployment
```
kubectl expose deployment myflaskapp-forminikube --type="LoadBalancer" --port 5000
```

###### View Deployment from host system (this will give the url where it is running)
```
minikube service myflaskapp-forminikube --url
```
you should see the container id where app is running .

###### Now scale application to use 5 containers
```
kubectl scale deployment myflaskapp-forminikube --replicas 5
```
Refresh the browser you should see different-different container id.

###### There should be exactly 5 pods running -
```
kubectl get pods
```

###### Scale down replica to 1 - 4 pods should die immediately !
```
kubectl scale deployment myflaskapp-forminikube --replicas 1
```

###### Rebuild the image
```
eval $(minikube docker-env)
#this will cause docker to build with the docker deaemon of minikube 
docker build -t mjindal/myflaskapp-forminikube:latest .
```
###### Now change the image
```
 kubectl set image deployment/myflask-app-forminikube *="mjindal/myflaskapp-forminikube:latest"
```
